        Initialized using:
        ```bash
        ansible-galaxy role init [NAME] --init-path=depin/services/roles
        ```

        ### Dependencies
        If an Ansible Role is needed because of a dependency ensure it's also initialized in `depin.libs`
        ```bash
        ansible-galaxy role init [NAME] --init-path=depin/libs/roles
        ```

        ### Commands

        ### Metrics

        - [ ] custom Prometheus collector (as necessary)
        > Not required if Service provides a prometheus endpoint that exposes the following
          minimum requirements:
            - status
            - reset / restart counter

        ### Logs

        - [ ] logs are collected via syslog
        
        ### 'galaxy.yml'

        - [ ] updated version by one minor step (1.0.0 => 1.1.0)
        > New Services should never create breaking changes but only adds new features

        - [ ] dependencies are updated for required collections

        ### Molecule

        - [ ] all `galaxy.yml` dependencies are added to `molecule/default/requirements.yml` for tests
        - [ ] passes default tests
